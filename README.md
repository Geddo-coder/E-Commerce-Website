# E-Commerce-Website using Springboot for Backend

Java Maven


The initial requirements


A friend has come to us with the intention of starting himself in the world
of business. He wants to sell products online and have an inventory
management system in a single solution. You suggest an existing third-
party application, but he wants something more bespoke. So he's come
to his rockstar developer pal, you!


The website will have users who can buy an array of products in different
quantities. It will hold the inventory of stock and allow users to make
orders to ship to their address.
